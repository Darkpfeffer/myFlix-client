                Creating both sides came with challenges, like getting the right 
                response from a specific endpoint, debugging if something 
                functioned wrong, giving the client-side the information it 
                needed from the database. I had to do a lot of research and ask 
                my tutor and mentor for tips to solve the problems that emerged 
                along the way, but now I feel confident about using React and 
                Node.js as well. Let us see the project in a bit more detail.

                API is the acronym for Application Programming Interface. It is a set 
                of rules defining how apps or devices can connect to and communicate 
                with each other. This step is the most crucial one at the backend, 
                because it assures the possibility to communicate with the client-side 
                and the database of the application.I used the package mongoose to be 
                able to connect with the database, and cors to specify the domains 
                that can communicate with the API.<br/>
                <br/>
                Challenges: At first I used the latest version of mongoose 
                (version 7.0.1), which didn't let me write any callback 
                functions, I could work only with premises. Later I downgraded 
                to version 6.0.3, after that the package worked how I wanted it 
                to work.

                It is an important step, because with creating schemas the 
                database won't contain any faulty code, which can prevent attacks 
                from hackers. Normally, MongoDB doesn't require the developer to 
                use schemas in order to use the database, so it is the API's work 
                to check the given schemas with "mongoose". I created the database 
                first, so I had the rules set up already, it wasn't much of a 
                challenge at this point.

                It is crucial for a single page application, because the 
                components are the views that will be rendered to the user. 
                At the early part of the project it was really hard to understand 
                how components work and how to connect them to each other and 
                transfer the data they need or they change. I got used to it 
                later on, and now I can use them confidently.

                This way after the user changes a view on the website, it will 
                get a new URL endpoint, and with the back button pressed, it 
                returns to the previous view of the website. The packages 
                react-router and react-router-dom have been used to reach this 
                goal. It was pretty easy to get used to it, and I found it an 
                easier solution than the use of event listeners.

                I did every required objective on the project in time, and I'm 
                satisfied with the result. But there are some improvement I'll 
                plan to implement:

                - If a user presses the favorite button, at this moment an alert 
                window pops up, showing that the movie was added/removed 
                successfully. I will change that only a full or an empty heart 
                will be shown depending if the movie is in the favorite list or 
                not.

                - I would change at the user data change, that only one data 
                should be changed at a time. Like this the user has the option 
                to change one after another, but they don't have to enter data 
                they don't even want to change.

        <Row className="mt-3 ps-5">
            <Col xs={{offset: 1, span: 10}}>
                - The final change is to rewrite the website to React Redux.
